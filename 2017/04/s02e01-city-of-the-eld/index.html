  <p><em>Session Date: 3/25/2017</em></p>

<p><em>Fresh off their successful home invasion of the</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> EMERALD ENCHANTER<em>, intrepid Thulian adventurers Flynn the Fortunate, Marvus the Wolf, and Ovek the Tall, along with their loyal half-beast henchman Grimbok, head into the</em> JUNGLE OF BURA </span><em>for some routine archaeological looting. Unfortunately, the targeted structure &ndash;ruins of the elvish</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> LAPIS OBSERVATORY<em>&ndash; is found to be currently occupied by the</em> ELD<em>, and the party is sucked into an</em> INTERDIMENSIONAL RIFT </span><em>(It was Ovek’s fault.)</em>
</p>

<h2 id="now">Now</h2>

<p>The party finds itself on a cliff overlooking a gray ocean beneath a sunless gray sky.  The ground is flat and coated with a coarse salt-like material. 300 foot-high worms dominate the view in most directions. It’s much colder than the jungle. Ovek and Flynn have each been switched with an alternate Ovek and Flynn from a parallel reality, but the alternates are close enough to the originals that no one is bothered.</p>

<p>The group begins to explore:</p>

<p><img src="/images/misty-isle-player-hex-1.jpg" alt="Campaign Map" /></p>

<p><em>Dark scribbles are coastline, railroad tracks lines are trails, wormy things are big wormy things. Each hex is .5 miles.</em></p>

<h3 id="area-15">Area 15</h3>

<p>Arrival area, cliffs.</p>

<h3 id="area-8">Area 8</h3>

<p>Paralyzed Eld stuck in an amber-filled bathtub, holding a wand. Ovek attempts to communicate telepathically and gets a hostile response. Flynn takes a Wand of Cure Wounds.</p>

<h3 id="area-17">Area 17</h3>

<p>An island with boat docks. Viewed but not visited.</p>

<h3 id="area-9">Area 9</h3>

<p>Peasant-henge. Spells cast inside the henge will have their effects doubled.</p>

<p><a name="area10"></a></p>

<h3 id="area-10">Area 10</h3>

<p>Pagoda city. Six streets of identical buildings (found to be empty facades) radiate from a central tower with a single entrance. The party makes two excursions into the tower.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/area-10-session-10-iso.png" alt="Area 10 Map" /></p>

<p>On the first, they find themselves locked in an “entrance trap” room (2) and escape by means of Flynn’s <em>knock</em> spell. 14 Eldish warriors are waiting on the other side of the door (1,7) but are dispatched with the help of Ovek’s new area effect blast power. Shortly later, more doors auto-lock, and Marvus is trapped in a hallway (connecting 1 and 3.) After plasma-torching the hallway door open, the party retreats to take a short rest.</p>

<p>On the second excursion, it’s found that every interior door seems to be internally barred. The party can only advance by means of <em>knock</em> or plasma torch, both of which are soon exhausted. Several Eldish items are grabbed from a supply locker (4) before another retreat, and Flynn is struck with a strange lawful urge to tidy the room.</p>

<h3 id="area-11">Area 11</h3>

<p>A complex consisting of a bunker-like building, three silos, and a tower with a bubble car parked on the roof.</p>

<p>Marvus immediately suggests stealing the bubble car. A guard on the tower roof spots the party as they begin their approach&hellip;</p>
