<h2 id="previously-on">Previously On</h2>

<p>The party has freed an imprisoned chaos god and is ready to <em>get paid</em>.</p>

<h2 id="session-notes">Session Notes</h2>

<h3 id="wish-fulfillment">Wish Fulfillment</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The carnifex emerges from her prison looking like a young woman but moving like a giant spider. It&rsquo;s kinda creepy. After waiting through three hours of out-of-game discussion, negotiation, and several changes of mind, she gets down to the business of granting wishes.</p></li>

<li><p>And oh yeah, exposure to so much wish-granting chaos is going to cause some unintended side-effects.</p></li>

<li><p>Marvus is now a miniature (9ft tall) cloud giant. He has the could giant racial traits and spell-like abilities, and is going to get more cloud-giant strength every time he levels up for a while. His wounded hand is healed and the <em>Sword of Vengence</em> curse is removed. Chaos mutations have left him with turquoise skin, all-black eyes, and three fingered hands. One hand is scaled and clawed, the other has tentacle fingers.</p></li>

<li><p>Grimbok undergoes the most extreme transformation. He has shed his half-beastman shell and emerged as the emo aasimar he always was inside. Now a paladin/warlock and official follower of the Carnifex, he wields a <em>Sword of Power</em>. His chaos mutations include black fingernails and skin lined with tattoo-like chaos symbols.</p></li>

<li><p>Ovek is now able to more efficiently wield his psionic power (every power costs him 1 pp less,) but also receives the most mutations: six-fingered hands, elongated goat legs, and leathery, scaly skin. At least the new legs make him move faster.</p></li>

<li><p>Flynn has become omni-magical: he can now learn any spell as though it were a wizard spell. He gets off pretty easy in the chaos-mutation department, just loosing the ability to cast a shadow.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="downtime">Downtime</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The party returns their tower, and wakes the next day to learn that the Temple of Rolep (a minor, millitant LN sun god) has been swallowed by a mysterious sinkhole. Sightings of three-headed ravens have been reported, and rumors of the Carnifex are everywhere. The fact that the party has spent the last few weeks gathering information about the Carnifex has not gone unnoticed.</p></li>

<li><p>Also, the galley crew &ndash;docked in Quodeth for the last four months&ndash; has spread stories of the party&rsquo;s exploits with the Eld all over town. They also haven&rsquo;t done a good job of keeping the bubble car a secret.</p></li>

<li><p>So, hoping to get ahead of the Carnifex rumors and to explain their altered appearance, Marvus and Grimbok concoct a story and tell it to the blabbermouth galley crew: Yes, the party went looking for the Carnifex and found her temple, but it was becasue they wanted to steal the <em>Jewels</em>. They found the temple and the <em>Jewels</em>, but were transformed by chaos while trying to remove them. If the Carnifex has returned, it has nothing to do with the party!</p></li>

<li><p>The party decides to embrace it&rsquo;s status and officially adopts a wealthy life-style. The Irtep Tower remodel continues, and servants are hired. Marvus, Grimbok and Ovek buy new wardrobes to fit their new bodies. Marvus considers commissioning some new plate mail, but changes his mind.</p></li>

<li><p>New tower arrangement:</p>

<ul>
<li>FIRST FLOOR: Trap, servant&rsquo;s quarters</li>
<li>SECOND FLOOR: Marvus. Has has a wall and door built to separate his room from the stair case.</li>
<li>THIRD FLOOR: Flynn.</li>
<li>FOURTH FLOOR: Kitchen, dining, commode.</li>
<li>FIFTH FLOOR: Ovek.</li>
<li><p>SIXTH FLOOR: Grimbok and the Ogre.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Flynn spends a week carousing, hoping to make a new contact that will help him add cleric spells to his spell book. It doesn&rsquo;t goal well, and he ends up making a new TBD &ldquo;hostile contact.&rdquo; After that, he spends a week doing volunteer work at the Temple of Ishtar (the popular CN love goddess,) and is rewarded with two cleric new spells.</p></li>

<li><p>Grimbok buys a Carnifex holy symbol, and though this brings him into contact other Carnifex worshipers, he tells them nothing of her return or of his paladin/warlock status.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dinner-and-exposition-with-jon-tobart">Dinner and Exposition with Jon Tobart</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The party accepts a dinner invitation from Jon Tobart, who lives in a tower a few blocks away from Irtrep Tower. His tower is one story taller than the party&rsquo;s. It has no visible doors or windows, and the party is greeted by a halfling-sized flesh golem who opens a secret door at street level. All of Jon Tobart&rsquo;s servants (that the party sees) are halfling-sized flesh golems. The party is led up an enclosed spiral staircase to a dining room on the sixth floor, and they see no other doors on the way up.</p></li>

<li><p>Dinner is sickly-grey boiled meat an vegetables, and Jon Tobart has an awkward manner that quickly leads the party to suspect that he might be a robot. Marvus tries to sense motive, and his sense is that there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much of a personality in which to sense.</p></li>

<li><p>When pressed, Jon Tobart tells his real story: he is an alien named Shazogrox and his human appearance is fake. He is an outcast from an evil race called the Greshtharx, and has been stranded in Thule for years. HOWEVER, he sees a chance for this to come to and end. He has spotted an object in the sky &ndash;an astroid&ndash; that he knows to be an ancient Greshtharx artifact. The interior of the astroid contains a powerful weapon that threatens all of Thule and even the entire world, but with the party&rsquo;s help, he can disarm the weapon and instead use it to leave Thule and go get revenge on the rest of Greshtharx.</p></li>

<li><p>HOWEVER, he needs the party&rsquo;s help. Powerful wards seal the interior of the astroid from entry by Greshtharxians, but there is an opening on the surface of astroid the leads to a secret entrance that only non-Greshtharxians (or those accompanied by non-Greshtharxians) can pass though.</p></li>

<li><p>He takes the party to the roof of his tower and show him an invention he calls the <em>Teloportoscope</em>: a telescope that will teleport the occupants of a large linked <em>teleportation circle</em> to whatever telescope is focused on. His plan is to park the bubble car in the <em>teleportation circle</em>, and use <em>Teloportoscope</em> to transport him, the party, and the bubble car up the astroid.</p></li>

<li><p>The party has two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What will you pays us?&rdquo; (the deed to Jon Tobart&rsquo;s tower)</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;How will we get back?&rdquo; (don&rsquo;t worry, Jon Tobart will take care of it.)</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>And with that, the party agrees to be blasted into space.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="space">Space</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The <em>Teloportoscope</em> process itself goes smoothly, but trouble starts immediately upon arrival. The bubble car (which operates on anti-gravitational principals) starts spinning wildly out of control in the absense of any gravitational field. Ovek manages to get it pointed in the large astroid, which, oddly, seems to have Earth-equivalent gravity (the party doesn&rsquo;t know this is odd.)</p></li>

<li><p>As soon is this is resolved, the party encounters a strange space going vessel:</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/uploads/beholder-scout-ship.png" alt="Beholder Scout Ship" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jon Tobart begins screaming in rage and pounding his fists as soon as he sees it. The vessel points it&rsquo;s weird eye-stalk at the bubble car, and the party can feel all magic go immediately dead. At the same time, something weird happens to Jon Tobart- his body starts to stretch and warp, and he becomes a&hellip; beholder! A beholder with a dead central eye, though. A beholder can&rsquo;t fit in the bubble car, so the hatch is forced open and beholder-Jon Torbart floats out into space and promptly disappears.</p></li>

<li><p>Ovek takes this opportunity to steer the bubble car directly toward the space vessel, and basts it with the bubble car&rsquo;s <em>fireball canon</em>. This was maybe not a good idea: the vessel returns fire and disables the bubble car with one shot. It crashes to the surface of the astroid&hellip;</p></li>
