  <p><em>Session date: 06/29/2019, Dave&rsquo;s house</em></p>

<h2 id="previously-on">Previously On</h2>

<p>The party has &ldquo;evicted&rdquo; the occupants and taken possession the <em>Defiance</em>, a wrecked spelljammer with a shattered <em>spelljamming helm</em>.</p>

<h2 id="session-notes">Session Notes</h2>

<h3 id="spelljammer-cleanup">Spelljammer cleanup</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The party decides to rest for a while, and take some time to investigate and clean up their new spelljammer. The find/learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>spelljamming helm</em> seems to have literally exploded while someone was sitting on it. Presumably Grimnar, who emerged from the disaster in his undead state.</li>
<li>His journals note that the helm had been acting up, and he might need to use the <em>spelljamming furnace</em> as a back up, but that also it didn&rsquo;t matter once he took possession of the RAVAGER.</li>
<li>The RAVAGER is what Grimnar called the astroid. He was specifically seeking it out.</li>
<li>Grimnar came from a city called the Rock of Braal, which is also on an astroid.</li>
<li>There are a bunch of charts and diagrams in the spelljammer describing star and planetary systems that the party doesn&rsquo;t recognize.</li>
<li>Six <em>bolts of beholder slaying</em> are found. Unfortunately, the party has no bows.
<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>The party also examines the <em>spelljamming furnace</em>, which can be used to temporarily power a spelljammer (or maybe even the bubble car) by burning magical items. A <em>ram-something-or-other</em> and the cursed <em>Sword of Vengeance</em> are nominated as candidates.</p></li>

<li><p>Lucan shows up and tells party that while they were fighting Grimnar, he met a nice guy named Jon Tobart, and helped him get in to the interior of the astroid.</p></li>

<li><p>The party decides that they&rsquo;d better head there themselves, and pile back into the bubble car. Lucan follows, nervously, because he&rsquo;s afraid of the &ldquo;beholder lich&rdquo; he says lives inside the asteroid.</p></li>

<li><p>Grimbok starts to worry that Lucan might be planning to betray them.</p></li>

<li><p>The tunnel ends at a huge circular door with a cheesy message on it. The message says that the astroid was built as a weapon for beholders by the Arcane, but they also built this backdoor that beholders can&rsquo;t open, so that heroes could come in and destroy the &ldquo;Queens Eyes&rdquo; to disable it.</p></li>

<li><p>Lucan says the Arcane are a secretive race who build stuff like this and sell it. Marvus says he&rsquo;d like to meet them.</p></li>

<li><p>The door slides open as soon as the party approaches. On the other side is a 300ft wide tunnel, perfectly round, running to the left and right. Also, the beholder lich!</p></li>

<li><p>Actually, it&rsquo;s just beholder zombie. There are three of them.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="beholder-zombie-battle">BEHOLDER ZOMBIE BATTLE</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Lucan flees in terror.</p></li>

<li><p>Flynn uses the <em>fire elemental egg</em> which he&rsquo;s been carrying around since like level three because the party doesn&rsquo;t use expendable items. It summons a fire elemental.</p></li>

<li><p>Ovek summons an air elemental.</p></li>

<li><p>The air and fire elemental then proceed to ruin the DMs fun by soaking up all the cool monster attacks.</p></li>

<li><p>Grimbok and Marvus do both get paralyzed by beholder rays, though.</p></li>

<li><p>Grimbok lobs fireballs.</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Lighting Bolt&rdquo; Flynn (his new name) hits all three zombies with a perfectly aligned lighting bolt attack, killing one.</p></li>

<li><p>Marvus kills the other two in the next round.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="into-the-asteroid-finally">Into the asteroid, finally</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/session_404_map.png" alt="Session 404 Map" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Back in the bubble car, the party enters the tunnel and travels in the leftward direction, eventually reaching a four-way intersection with another tunnel. Ovek&rsquo;s air elemental follows the bubble car.</p></li>

<li><p>The party checks out the tunnel branch to the right. It leads to a vast, curved, tubular area, lit by a giant floating crystal. There is an exit tunnel directly across the tube from the entrance (about 1.8 kilometers away).  Scrubland and canyons cover the interior surface of the tube, and it appears to be inhabited by by stone giant goatherds. A rock slams into bubble car. It isn&rsquo;t large enough to do damage, but the area around the impact site temporarily turns to stone. The party decides to go elsewhere.</p></li>

<li><p>The left tunnel branch leads into what appears to be interior of one of the obelisks. The obelisk is capped by transparent crystal but otherwise empty. The party can see that several space-beholder spaceships are, as promised, waiting for them outside the asteroid.</p></li>

<li><p>The party returns to the main tunnel, and travels until they reach another intersection. To the left is presumably another obelisk. The right leads to another huge room, also lit by a huge floating crystal, and with an exit tunnel on the other side.  This room is is a half-hemisphere with rune covered walls. It&rsquo;s empty except for boulders bouncing back and forth, breakout-style. The boulders, unlike the rocks in the stone giant goatherd room, are plenty large enough to do significant damage to the bubble car. Ovek sends his air elemental in to in investigate, but the party ultimately decides that this isn&rsquo;t something they really want to fuck with right now.</p></li>
